Freedom of religion implies security. The one who
is religious should feel safe, not merely as an
individual, but as a community. They should be able
to attend public worship. Today's public worship is
facilitated by data. However, those who hate religion or a particular form may use that data to hurt the community. Therefore, it is essential to
uphold human rights by facilitating secure connections:

1. Geolocation identifying members, catered texts
to phone.
2. Geolocation identifying non-members.
=> identifying those who strive to enter
without identification. Potential threats.
=> Database for local police, national directory. 
3. Mapping location of assembly to members.
4. Chatrooms
5. Forums
6. Video feeds
7. PayPal donations
8. Correlation between donations and
a particular needs, vs. leaders pocketing
for their own use or bias. ???
9. Webcrawler scraping data for issues needing
address in lectures/counseling online.
10. Surveys
11. Integration of all assemblies within the
larger community county, state, nation, and
globally.
12. Matchmaking for friendship, work, and marriage.
13. Resources for an education balancing STEM with
the arts and humanities, or the humanities and arts
with STEM. New extreme and old extremes overcome.
14. Resources for business, money management.
15. Hygiene and Health.
16. Social sciences: psychology, sociology, economics, and political science.
