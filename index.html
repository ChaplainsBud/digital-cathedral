    <p>This is a blueprint for all digital religious buildings.
    The goal here is to scale architecture down to the individual
  monk cell all the way up to an epic cathedral. Actually, the
 hermetic desert monk will be granted a place as well -- solitude
 will be communal for all, but in a different way.</p>

  <aside>
  <p>We are almost all online, so this will help those with a religious
  bent find their way home, rather than get lost in the distraction of
materialism, be it substance abuse, sexual addition, anxiety-driven learning,
fear driven news reading, as well as taking an aggressive stance towards online
shopping, stealing, vandalism through building viruses, and so on. This is an
oasis for those who want to come back home, as well as those who have nevver been
home in the first place -- old and new religionists.</p>

    <p>This version is done without create-react-app and even the
    express-generator. There is no view engine for pug, transpilation
  from scss to css, nor watching typescript for javascript. It's barebones.</p>

  <footer>
    <p>You also won't find mocha/chai/jest testing. Nor will you see Heroku
    deployment, or Jenkins CI. Those are all in my mind though, and will eventually
  show up. Maybe even jQuery will come up, and most likely reactstrap combining
Bootstrap 4 with React. Redux.
